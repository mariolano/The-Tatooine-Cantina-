# The Tatooine Cantina
This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in a fun, Star Warsâ€“themed scenario. The program predicts whether a new alien entering the Tatooine Cantina is dangerous or not, based on its similarity to known aliens.
## What the Project Does? 
- Reads alien attribute data (color, height, weight, eyes) from a CSV file.
- Converts categorical attributes into numeric coordinates for analysis.
- Uses the KNN classification algorithm to compare a new alien against existing ones.
- Predicts whether the alien is dangerous using a majority-vote system among its k-nearest neighbors.
## Why the Project is Useful? 
This project provides a hands-on way to:
- Learn the fundamentals of KNN, one of the earliest and simplest machine learning algorithms.
- Practice object-oriented programming in Python.
- Explore data preprocessing and conversion of categorical data into numeric formats.
- See how AI/ML concepts can be applied in creative, story-driven scenarios.
